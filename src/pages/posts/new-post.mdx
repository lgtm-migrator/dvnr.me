I hate UNIST, for now that is.

That's a pretty bold claim, isn't it? To hate a university that myself, back in the days
of highschool, dreamt of getting into.

## A little bit of background

So at UNIST, freshmen have to spend an entire first year studying
through the extensive list of basic-science courses. And if you know me,
you can probably say that I'm not really good at them. Anyhow, I barely could
make it through the first year. That's not to say I didn't try &mdash; I did!

The first few weeks I failed at understanding the most of the words instructors said in
their broken english (or must I say konglish?) during the class. And I wasn't
the only one struggling with this: 99% of internationals did as well!
I tried sitting in the front desk, but to no avail. I've completely lost
my interest in those subjects even before the first exams came in!

But it's only fair to say that I've been eagerly waiting untill the days when I'd
finally study my major (Computer Science) courses.

## When all the fun began

Then, those days have eventually arrived, and oh boy, did I love them!
OOP, Intro to AI (Deep Learning basics), Engineering Programming, Discrete Maths!

However, that very semester (which was my 3rd one at UNIST) I've experienced
some personal problems (constant exhaustion coupled with a minor depression).
All I could ever do then was to stay up late doing my homeworks, run around the campus
for half an hour, shower and get to sleep at around 4AM only to wake up again for my morning
classes.

Though I didn't experience a burnout making my way through those endless assignments, because
I actually enjoyed the process! Thus, I've ended up getting all A-s in my major courses and
setting my personal GPA record that semester.

## When fun became challenging

As of May 2020, it's my 6th semester at UNIST and I'll become a senior next semester.

After the basic and mainly an "intro to CS" classes, it was time for some "real-deal" courses.
By that I mean the likes of _Operating Systems_, _Networks_, _Principles of Programming Languages_, and
_Computer Security_.

Of which I truly only enjoyed the _Computer Security_ class taught by professor _Hyungon Moon_.
Probably because it was the only (apart from OS, about that later below) practically
applicable class with CTF (capture the flag) assignments with increasing order of difficulties
throughout the semester. Although the main focus was too narrowed to cracking ELF executables,
that was quite a fun!

There is another course which is practical at its core: _Operating Systems_. Though it's a
total rip-off of the one from _Stanford_ where you'd implement a toy OS called _Pintos_.

There are tons and tons of open source solutions for any of the assignments for it, which makes
it hard for people to learn for themselves rather than copying from someone else's work.

Although the instructors are quite strict about plagiarism, there are some easy ways to cheat
like obfuscating the code. And there is also another side to the problem: _Pintos_ is hard and
the only resource to learn about is an instructor whose pronunciation is an absolute nightmare
(I'm not trying ot be racist or anything, that's just a fact)!

Anyway, I did learn a lot by spending tremendous amounts of time for those assignments.
Take for example the time when I set out to hunt a nasty _memory-leak_ which wouldn't get _free_-d
because of an unreachable part of the method. Whoa, that was some experience I wouldn't
have ever dreamt about!
