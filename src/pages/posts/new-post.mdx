I hate UNIST.

Yeah, that's a pretty bold claim, isn't it?

So at UNIST, freshmen have to spend an entire first year studying
through the extensive list of basic-science courses. And if you know me,
you can probably say that I'm not really good at them. Anyhow, I barely could
make it through the first year. That's not to say I didn't try &mdash; I did!
The first few weeks I failed at understanding most of the words instructors said in
their broken english (or must I say Konglish?) during the class. And I wasn't
the only one struggling with this &mdash; 99% of Internationals did as well!
I tried sitting in the front desk, but to no avail &mdash; I've completely lost
my interest in the subjects even before the first exams came in!

But it's only fair to say that I've been eagerly waiting untill the days when I'd
finally study my major (Computer Science) courses.

Then, those days have eventually arrived, and oh boy &mdash; did I love them!
OOP, Intro to AI (Deep Learning basics), Engineering Programming, Discrete Maths!

However, that very semester (which was my 3rd one at UNIST) I've experienced
severe personal difficulties (constant exhaustion coupled with a minor depression).
All I could ever do then was staying up late doing my homeworks, run around the campus
for half an hour, shower and get to sleep at around 4AM only to wake up again for my morning
classes. I didn't experience a burnout making my way through those endless assignments, because
I actually enjoyed the process! Thus, I've ended up getting all A-s in my major courses and
setting my personal record in GPA that semester.
