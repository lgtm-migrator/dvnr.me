In a total span of around 9 months I quit WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram altogether.

It wasn't easy, especially quitting WhatsApp hit me the hardest.
All of my family members and friends used it as their main messaging app.

But hey, I didn't have to feel a little guilty leaving yet another annoying groupchat anymore!
By the time I quit WhatsApp, I got the most important people to use [Telegram](https://telegram.org),
and I was able to click the delete button.

I didn't use Facebook a lot back then. I even switched to using only the web app.
Mostly because I stumbled upon [this tweet](https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1167463054709334017)
showing how their app on Android scans and uploads local libraries to their servers,
probably for device fingerprinting. Turns out it's a common practice for "research and security"
purposes.

I have long detested Facebook itself. But not so long ago, they started showing
users what other apps share about them with Facebook.
Say if I were to use some totally unrelated game,
they would know what I've been up to in there.

Sure, I knew they collected a lot of user data. But when I saw my Overheard ("–ü–æ–¥—Å–ª—É—à–∞–Ω–æ")
Stories app on that list, which I never ever granted access nor have been aware of their connections,
I lost it. That was the last straw.

I did use Messenger a lot though. After coming to UNIST, it became the main source of contact with
many other students and local people.

There were some strange times when I'd forget to check for new messages from important people
like UNIST's International Affairs team. They would simply ask other people to contact me
to contact them.

Anyway, on March 14, the Pi Day, I permanently left Facebook!
