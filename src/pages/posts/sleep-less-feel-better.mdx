As the lazy days of post-semester break come to an end, the painful reality of predawn
alarms and endless assignments strike UNIST students. Let us take a look inside a lecture room on one of those days.
You will most likely encounter a professor vigorously speaking to students sitting at their desks. If
you take a closer look, you will see that students are either nodding off or completely asleep. It is quite natural of you to think that
students are not getting enough sleep, especially when they are doing more than ever with their time. However, sleep is not just a
quantity, but it is rather about the _quality_. Have you ever heard one claiming that adults
need _8 hours_ while children need _10_ in order to get enough sleep? You better forget that, as the science already accepted it as a _myth_.

Those who sleep two times less are _neither zombies nor supermen_ - they simply enjoy
a much more organized sleep routine. To
understand this better, let us break the sleep
into **_phases_**:

First phase is _**light** sleep phase_. It is like when
you snooze in a lecture and find out that 5
minutes have passed already when you wake
up. Next is _**deep** sleep_, usually described as
when your brain tries to switch itself off. The
third phase will be _**delta** sleep_, which is the
_most crucial_ phase where your body and
brain relaxes, heart rate slows down and the
body temperature decreases. Then the _**REM** sleep phase_ kicks in; your eyes move rapidly
from side to side behind closed eyelids.
That is why this phase is called _REM (Rapid Eye Movement)_. You breathe faster and
irregularly, while your heart rate and blood
pressure move back to their normal state. A
complete sleep cycle lasts for about _90 minutes_
and usually repeated several times every
night.

Before we start discussing organizing the
routine, there is one more thing you should
definitely consider – your body temperature.
During the day, our body temperature
doesn’t stay exactly at 36.6 Celsius degrees
but rather it varies plus or minus two degrees.
Just like you keep your body temperature high when you are active, accordingly you
should keep it low while asleep.

Now that you are aware of how sleep works,
let us consider some general rules for an ideal
everyday sleep routine. Waking up _exactly_ at
the REM phase is crucial. You can find this
phase by adding (or subtracting) ten to thirty
minutes to (or from) your usual alarm time.
Hence, plan your night so you wake up at the
end of a sleep cycle - _even_ on weekends. This
is for your body to get used to the routine. For
instance, if you have to get out of your bed at
_6 AM_ on weekdays, you should do the same
on weekends to have your body disciplined.
After you succeed leaving your place of rest,
it is better to perform around twenty minutes
of workout. This way your body temperature
will rise and eventually, it will keep you away
from falling asleep. During the daytime, drink
plenty of water and limit the usage of energizers,
alcohol and caffeine alike substances. If
you feel sleepy and need to relax, take a power
nap for about ten to twenty minutes at noon,
keeping in mind that it is vital to wake up before
entering the delta phase. And stay cool!
You might get a good night’s rest if you sleep
in a cool room.

Indeed, everything mentioned above matters
a lot, but maybe the most principal factor
in having a good sleep is to limit the use of
smartphones and social media at least one
hour prior to sleeping, as the blue-and-white
light given off by your phones can prevent you
from falling asleep for a long time.

These tips are so simple, yet they require
some conscious effort. All in all, we are all
very different people and respond in various
ways as to how we can fall asleep better. By
following these simple tips every day, not only
can UNIST students feel more productive in
everything they do, but also feel ready to take
on the world!
